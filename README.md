# Spiral_Arms_Mass_Project
SampleSelection_fin - Selects spiral galaxies within the MaNGA sample
<br />OneGalaxyCode - Combines Pipe3D and Galaxy Zoo3D maps, plots binned stellar mass averages for a single spiral galaxy in the MaNGA sample
<br />FewGalaxiesCode - Mostly the same plots for a little larger sample of galaxies; Excess in stellar mass in spiral arms plot

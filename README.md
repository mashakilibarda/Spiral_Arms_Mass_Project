# Spiral_Arms_Mass_Project
SampleSelection_fin - Selects spiral galaxies within the MaNGA sample
<br />
<br />OneGalaxyCode - Combines Pipe3D and Galaxy Zoo3D maps, plots binned stellar mass averages for a single spiral galaxy in the MaNGA sample
<br />
<br />AFewGalaxiesCode - Mostly the same plots as in OneGalaxyCode but for a little larger sample of galaxies; Excess in stellar mass in spiral arms plot
<br />
<br />arm_vs_interarm_mass - A loop that runs on the entire sample of galaxies and appends relevant data into a text file
<br />
<br />AllGalaxiesCode - Cleaning out the sample based on different criteria and making a mass excess plot for the entire sample of galaxies
<br />
<br />BarsSubsample - Plots the difference in the stellar mass excess trends in type S vs type SB galaxies in the sample
